<h3><strong>WEEK 2 BONUS POINTS BEGIN MONDAY, JUNE 30TH!</strong></h3>
<p>You can log in your points at the Active For Life Site <a href="http://www.activeforlife.org">HERE</a></p>
<h3><strong>IT&#8217;S ALL ABOUT DRINKING PLENTY OF WATER</strong></h3>
<h3><b style="font-size: 13px;"></b><span style="font-size: 13px;">This Week’s bonus points is all about HYDRATION! With all of the exercising you are doing it’s imperative that you drink plenty of water to replenish the body after sweating. But there are a great many other health benefits of being properly hydrated:</span></h3>
<p>Please see the table below to determine how much water you need to be drinking each day.</p>
<p><b>1. Increases Energy &amp; Relieves Fatigue</b> – Since your brain is mostly water, drinking it helps you think, focus and concentrate better and be more alert. As an added bonus, your energy levels are also boosted!</p>
<p><b>2. Promotes Weight Loss </b>– Removes by-products of fat, reduces eating intake (by filling up your tummy if consumed prior to meals), reduces hunger (hello natural appetite suppressant!), raises your metabolism and has zero calories!</p>
<p><b>3. Flushes Out Toxins </b>– Gets rid of waste through sweat and urination which reduces the risk of kidney stones and UTI’s (urinary tract infections).</p>
<p><b>4. Improves Skin Complexion </b>– Moisturizes your skin, keeps it fresh, soft, glowing and smooth. Gets rid of wrinkles. It’s the best anti-aging treatment around!</p>
<p><b>5. Maintains Regularity</b> – Aids in digestion as water is essential to digest your food and prevents constipation.</p>
<p><b>6. Boosts Immune System</b> – A water guzzler is less likely to get sick. And who wouldn’t rather feel healthy the majority of the time? Drinking plenty of water helps fight against flu, cancer and other ailments like heart attacks.</p>
<p><b>7. Natural Headache Remedy</b> – Helps relieve and prevent headaches (migraines &amp; back pains too!) which are commonly caused by dehydration.</p>
<p><b>8. Prevents Cramps &amp; Sprains</b> &#8211; Proper hydration helps keep joints lubricated and muscles more elastic so joint pain is less likely.</p>
<p><b>9. Puts You in a Good Mood</b> – When the body is functioning at its best, you will feel great and be happy!</p>
<p><b>10. Save Money!</b> &#8211; Water is FREE! Even if you choose bottled/filtered water, it’s STILL cheaper than that high sugar and fat-filled latte!</p>
<p><b>HOW MUCH WATER SHOULD I BE DRINKING?</b></p>
<p>We are asking that you drink the recommended amount listed below and accounting for the extra water you should drink if you are exercising. You should add 12 ounces of water to your daily total for every 30 minutes that you work out. So if you work out for 45 minutes daily, you would add 18 ounces of water to your daily intake. It may seem like a lot but consider the size of many water bottles that are 20 oz. or more! So if you are 150 pounds and need to drink 100 ounces before you exercise, that’s five 20 oz. bottles.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://10.24.32.45/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Ciara.png"><img class="wp-image-9130 alignleft" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" alt="Ciara" src="http://10.24.32.45/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Ciara.png" width="145" height="160" /></a></strong><em>Ciara Breen is majoring in Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology 2015. She is working in Asset Protection as the Safety and Risk Summer Associate working on re-writing the Guide to Safety and ‘Safety Topics’, reaching out to the stores by answering safety questions or concerns as well as updating them of safety policy changes, helping with the roll-out of a new product that is being tested in two districts, and applying for America’s Safest Companies award.</em></p>
<div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ab2328;">Strozzi and SMART Sessions:</span></h3>
<p><strong><i>“</i><i>As a summer associate in the Home Office, it is inspiring to see a smiling face greet you everywhere you go and I can’t help but think that is due to the positive leadership and tremendous commitment dressbarn shows to its valued associates.”<br />
</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><i>___________________________________________________________________________________</i></strong></p>
<p>In our second week, the Summer Associates attended a <a title="Strozzi" href="http://10.24.32.45/strozzi/">Strozzi</a> session; a word we had heard a lot about, and were still unfamiliar with. Standing in a circle, we were introduced to Strozzi by Denise Bailey, the session leader, by connecting with our mood. We were asked to express our mood in one word. This proved to be a difficult task as it was foreign for me to show vulnerability to my peers. We then moved into a practice known as ‘centering’. <b><i>When you are centered, you are connected to yourself; you become more present to others and your mood, are more open to possibilities, and become focused on what you care about.</i></b> We practiced being aware of our bodies and focused on how we were breathing and the areas we held stress – our shoulders, legs, neck, and hands. Once we became aware, we practiced relaxing those areas and let the stress and worries fall away.</p>
<p>Next we were led through a few exercises of walking around the room. Initially, everyone was unsure and didn’t make a lot of eye contact. We then did the same exercise and were asked to be more aware of the space of others, walking with our heads up, making eye contact and smiling. This showed a pleasant change in the group as I observed everyone seemed more confident in themselves. Continuing the same exercise, half of us were then told to pretend as if we were distracted by our phones while still moving around the room. After this exercise, we discussed that we collectively felt ignored by those that were distracted. In today’s world, it is very easy to shut out what is going on around you and be tuned in to your own device. I took away from that exercise how impersonal it was to come upon someone who was more involved in their phone and how important it is to walk with your head up, facing the world head-on<b><i>. Since the initial Strozzi introduction, I have gone to a few other sessions and have been taught to be more aware of how I present myself, both in posture and poise, as well as my reactions to a ‘grab’, a situation that surprises you, and how reactions can be perceived differently than you intend. </i></b></p>
<p>The Summer Associates also went to a SMART Session and were introduced to the SMART Girl. Having worked at the store level for five years before coming to the Home Office, I have seen the evolution of dressbarn’s target customer. I greatly enjoyed the extensive research into who the SMART Girl is and what she wants as well as the planned surveys to continue to evolve with our SMART Girl<b><i>. It is inspiring to see the new brand, vision, and glimpse into the future.</i></b></p>
<p>As a summer associate in the Home Office, it is inspiring to see a smiling face greet you everywhere you go and I can’t help but think that is due to the positive leadership and tremendous commitment dressbarn shows to its valued associates<b><i>. I think that the mission of dressbarn and the BELIEVE values are clearly shown by offering the Strozzi leadership practice so the associates can grow as encouraging leaders, earning trust, and building relationships, both personally and professionally.</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ab2328;"><b>What is your go-to clothing apparel/accessory that makes you look and feel good?<br />
</b></span>I am a firm believer that nothing can stop a woman in an exceptionally fitted pair of jeans and a statement necklace!</p>
